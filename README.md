# MNIST-Neural-Network-Training

Code for training a 300 hidden unit neural network with data from the MNIST handwritten digit database. Training input is expected in form of a CSV file, with each row beginning with the correct number value answer, followed by all 784 pixels of the 28 x 28 image of the number.
Values of a fully trained 300 hidden neuron neural network is provided in file trained_nn.js.
